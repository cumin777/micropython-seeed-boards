# Freeze the XIAO STM32C5 helper modules into the firmware image (production firmware).
# Test scripts (xiao_stm32c5_base_test.py / xiao_stm32c5_can_test.py / can_interconnect.py)
# are NOT frozen -- upload them via Thonny / mpremote when testing is needed.
# micropython's frozen _boot.py is intentionally NOT frozen here: v1.27.0
# auto-runs it on boot (ports/zephyr/main.c: pyexec_frozen_module("_boot.py"))
# and its storage init hangs on this board, blocking the REPL. Storage
# auto-mount stays disabled until the underlying storage path is fixed.
